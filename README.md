# NiBabel Presentations

## Get started

```Shell
pipenv run jupyter-notebook
```

A browser window will open, and you can select the `.py` file.
These are [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) presentations,
and there should be a button to start presentation mode at the right side of
the toolbar.

Note that RISE currently works with `jupyter-notebook`, not `jupyterlab`.

## List of presentations:

* [NiBabel.py](NiBabel.py) - Broad introduction to NiBabel concepts and APIs.
  Initially given at [NeuroHackademy 2020](https://neurohackademy.org/neurohack_year/2020/)
* [nibabel-whatsnew2021.py](nibabel-whatsnew2021.py) - 15-20 minute introduction, highlighting
  changes from 2019-2021.
